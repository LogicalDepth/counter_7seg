### 7 Segement LED Interfacing
The Project uses BeagleBone Board as the main unit to control the 7 segement LED using C code .

## Hardware Used
. Beaglebone Board (SOC).
. Jumper Wires
. BreadBoard
. USB-t-UART
. 7 Segement LED

The basic flow of the project is the controlling of GPIO's through the C code. Unlike Bare Metal , here we have used OS based Microcontroller , which provides us with GPIO's at kernel level . Thus by controlling those gpio's which are further connected to the LED and by implementing C code , we are controlling the LEDs.

Futher on , The project gives some LED controls :
. Up-Counting 
. Down-Counting
. UpDown Counting
. Random Counting
